## Installation

To get started with NeuraFlux, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   First, clone the NeuraFlux repository to the desired machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuraflux.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies with Poetry**
    The package uses **Poetry** to manage dependencies and virtual environments. If you haven't installed Poetry yet, installation steps can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

    Once Poetry is installed, move to the project directory and run

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    to install all project dependencies.

3. **Docker Deployment**
    The package features and components will soon be dockerized, allowing them to run seamlessly in a containerized environment.

## Overview
